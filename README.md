# Equations
A very simple equation solver.

## Introduction

It will work in the lines of simple equations with variables and values:

- x = 5 + 3
- 2 = y + 1
- z = z + y

...will conclude x = 8, y = -1, z = 7.

**Limitations**: only additions in equations (of any number of terms). Only simple equations, i.e., x^1. 

## Build
It is created as a Python app, but it is also prepared for **PyCharm**.
